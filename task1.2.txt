Foreign keys are used to link tables within a database, aims to achieve interconnections between different data entries from different tables. In the database schema above, I used User_ID and Room_ID from table Users and Rooms as foreign keys, which are responsible for storing the reservee and room number, that enabled us to refer to individual rooms and users by using them. Without those IDs we would not be able to specify individual reservee and room according to each booking entry.
